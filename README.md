# My-Portfolio-website
My personal portfolio website (version 2)


I took inspiration from a previous portfolio website in that I wanted to do something in a complete opposite spectrum. While there were a lot of colors used in accents with button hover effects and small details the website had a very dark theme.
This website I had the idea to rather do something light themed and to add more information about myself. I have been seeing these amazing gradients online on pinterest and other sites that always managed to catch my eye, so I decided to incorporate that into the design of my portfolio website.

My portfolio website will have multiple pages stating my information and services but the main page will have an overview of all the information.
Extra features in the portfolio:
	A back to top button.
	Social media icons added and correctly linked.
	One CSS/JS animation.
	Slider or carousel in the gallery page.
	Form validation on the contact page.
